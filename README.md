# AI-Generated-Art-NFT
# AI-Generated NFT Smart Contract

This project is a Solidity-based smart contract designed to create AI-generated art NFTs with dynamic metadata. The contract allows an owner to mint and update NFTs, providing a flexible solution for digital artwork representation.

## Features

1. **AI-Generated Art NFT** - Mints NFTs for AI-generated artwork.
2. **Dynamic Metadata** - Allows updating metadata for each NFT.
3. **Ownership Tracking** - Assigns and tracks NFT ownership.
4. **No Constructor** - Deployable without requiring constructor input.
5. **No External Imports** - Fully self-contained Solidity contract.
6. **Restricted Minting & Updates** - Only the contract owner can mint and modify NFTs.
7. **Deployed on Edu Chain** - Address: `0xD6C4bE1CDBB2bBCd30FC70F59Da1b089dD8C00E1`

## Prompt

**Prompt Used:**
> "Create NFTs for AI-generated art with dynamic metadata, write this smart contract in Solidity, no imports and constructors, with no input fields."

## Deployment

This smart contract is deployed on the **Edu Chain**, ensuring a secure and transparent way to manage AI-generated NFT assets.

## Usage

- The contract owner can mint new NFTs by assigning metadata.
- Metadata of an existing NFT can be updated by the owner.
- Users can retrieve metadata using the `getNFT()` function.
